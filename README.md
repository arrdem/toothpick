Toothpick is a toolkit for idiomaticly generating inspectable assembler bytecode
from Clojure. It is intended for use in compilers and translators, but the truly
adventurous could no doubt perform manual code generation and force the JVM to
execute the result.

Toothpick is joined at the hip to
[Batbridge](https://github.com/arrdem/batbridge), which is the development
target architecture for Toothpick.

## Status

!["Leiningen version"](https://clojars.org/me.arrdem/toothpick/latest-version.svg)

Toothpick has reached a `0.1.0` state, as the assembler itself is
feature complete and Toothpick has successfully build and run code on
bytecode enabled Batbridge simulators. Batbridge now uses Toothpick as
an assembler backend for its test suite.

Soon to come is a JVM bytecode module, followed by some subset of Intel
x86_64. These will be paired with matching simulators and tools for running the
bytecode on "bare metal" so it may be some time.

**Working Components**

 - `toothpick.architecture` provides a sane and probably stable
   interface for defining the instructions which constitute an
   instruction set.
   
 - `toothpick.architecture` ISAs provide the information needed to
   build structured instruction representations into raw bytes
   executable by hardware or bytecode simulators.

 - `toothpick.assembler` provides a full label based assembler as
   demonstrated below. At present however there is no good assembler
   support for compiling data segments or other common
   structures. There is also no support for variable length
   instruction encodings. These are both on the TODO list.
   
 - `toothpick.isa.batbridge` provides a full definition of the
   Batbridge instruction set used as the target of my blog post series
   on processor design and implementation.

## Usage

```Clojure
user> (require '[toothpick.assembler :refer [assemble]]])
nil
user> (require '[toothpick.isa.batbridge :as bb])
nil
user> (assemble bb/batbridge
       [[:add 0 29 30 15]
	    [:sub 1 30 29 15]])
(3223187471 3292456975)
user> (assemble bb/batbridge
       [:start
	    [:add 0 29 30 15]
		[:sub 1 30 29 15]
		:end
		[:add 31 30 29 :start]])
(3223187471 3292456975 3288262656)
```
