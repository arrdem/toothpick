Toothpick is a toolkit for idiomaticly generating inspectable assembler bytecode
from Clojure. It is intended for use in compilers and translators, but the truly
adventurous could no doubt perform manual code generation and force the JVM to
execute the result.

Need I remind you that no warantee is provided with this software?
