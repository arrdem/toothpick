Toothpick is a toolkit for idiomaticly generating inspectable assembler bytecode
from Clojure. It is intended for use in compilers and translators, but the truly
adventurous could no doubt perform manual code generation and force the JVM to
execute the result.

Need I remind you that no warantee is provided with this software?


## Status

At the moment `experimental` is generous for describing Toothpick's
status. `dangerous` would probably be a more apt description.

**Working Components**

 - `toothpick.architecture` provides a sane and probably stable
   interface for defining the instructions which constitute an
   instruction set.
 - `toothpick.architecture` ISAs provide the information needed to
   build an `(instruction, params)` pair to raw bytes.
 - `toothpick.isa.batbridge` provides a full definition of the
   BatBridge instruction set used as the target of my blog post series
   on processor design and implementation.

## Usage

```Clojure
;; TODO write a badass demo
```
